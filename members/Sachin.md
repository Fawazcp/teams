# Hi, I am Sachin Manocha, Age 45

Presently I am Working as a Project Manager Looking after a digitization Project of Madhya Pradesh District Courts.
Till now Our team has digitized 40 crore pages and uploaded on a centralized repository at MPHC Jabalpur
My major tasks involve looking after the daily progress of team deployed at 47 locations in MP. I deal directly with Client to gather their requirements related to applications implemented for archival and retrieval of digitized data. Managing the database and resolving day to day issues reported by team as well as client. I am having Knowledge of SQL Server, Queries, VMware, Windows and Linux OS along with knowledge of networking etc.
After such vast experience my focus is now shifted towards cloud computing I have been learning AWS from last 6 months taking some time of my busy schedules for my personal growth. I have learned various services.
I am looking for hands on project on cloud and automation and ready to learn DevOps tools like Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins (CI CD)
Any suggestions and support to start the learning and Growing Journey is always welcome.
I am open to support any one within my limited Knowledge
